# BlackJack-
 A Game of Cards

# Rules

*Here’s your basic guide of how to play blackjack:* 

<ul>
<li> Your goal in blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21. </li>
<li> You’ll receive 2 cards at the beginning of each round, and you’ll add up the values of these cards. </li>
<li> Cards 2-10 have face value; King, Queen, Jack are worth 10; and Aces are either a 1 or an 11 — it’s up to you to decide. </li>
<li> The dealer also draws two cards. The aim of the game is to beat his hand (have a higher hand) without going over 21. </li>
<li> If you would like the dealer to deal you another card, you tell him “hit” </li>
<li> If you do not want to be dealt another card, you “stand” </li>
<li> “Busting” is when the sum of your hand is over 21. </li>
<li> The winner of the round is whoever has the highest hand without going bust. </li>
</ul>
